The files in this directory and its associated subdirectories contain
the source code and soltutions to the exercises from the book 
``Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example'' 
by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo 
(Addison-Wesley 2000, ISBN 0-201-70353-X).

I have compiled and run these files on three different os:

linux (ubuntu, mint)
	
	using g++

osx

	using g++ (X-Code)

windows
	
	using g++ (MinGW)
	installed MinGW
	added C:\MinGW\bin to PATH
		MyComputer -> Properties -> Advanced Properties:
			append ;C:\MinGW\bin to PATH variable


Here is a nice online solution to the exercises:
